Changelog pyGPs v1.2
=====================

June 30th 2014
----------------

structural updates:

- input target now can either be in 2-d array with size (n,1) or in 1-d array with size (n,)
- setup.py updated
- "import pyGPs" instead of "from pyGPs.Core import gp"
- rename ".train()" to ".optimize()"
- rename "Graph-stuff" to "graphExtension"
- rename kernelOnGraph to "nodeKernels" and graphKernel to "graphKernels"
- redundancy removed for model.setData(x,y)
- rewrite "mean.proceed()" to "getMean()" and "getDerMatrix()"
- rewrite "cov.proceed()" to "getCovMatrix()" and "getDerMatrix()"
- rename cov.LIN to cov.Linear (to be consistent with mean.Linear)
